# IcarusInBloom
Android project - Organizational app for plant owners

## _DESCRIPTION_

![Flowmap](flowmap.png "Flowmap")

  "Icarus in Bloom" is a project for an Android app whose **main purpose** is helping plant owners better track the plants they have and their needs. 
  
 The app is meant to have a couple of useful functionalities, such as: a main view of all your plants (including pics, name, and a small description), another view where you can check which plants need watering / change of soil / etc., and _maybe_ a forum with discussions from more plant owners.   

## _MOTIVATION_

  Are there apps like this already? Yes, most probably. But, being the broke college student that I am, paying 5$ for an app like that seems too much so I am making my own.
  
  Also, plants:
  - [x] cute
  - [x] i like them
  - [x] give oxygen
